3D engine for rendering wireframes (with backface removal and simulated black fill, so they're not really wireframes at all).

  * Fully compatible with J2ME, `BlackBerry`, and plain Java, the core library (not the renderer) should be compatible with almost any Java variant (Android, Kindle platform, etc...)
  * Includes simple sample space invaders-style demo game ([playable here](http://wanderinggames.com/tiki-index.php?page=3DLite::play)).
  * Has light-weight 3D model format.
  * Very efficient, runs on almost any device
  * Matrix manipulation library included
